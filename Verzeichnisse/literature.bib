In the field of human-technology interaction, a plethora of personality-related constructs linked to the experience of and interaction with technical systems has been discussed. A key question for researchers in the field is thus: Which are the key personality concepts and scales for characterizing inter-individual differences in user technology interaction? Based on a literature review and citation analysis, a structured overview of frequently used technology-related personality constructs and corresponding self-report scales is provided. Changes in the popularity and content of scales and concepts that occured over time as well as overlap between constructs and scales are discussed to facilitate scale selection.},

  abstract   = {Successful coping with technology is relevant for mastering daily life. Based on related conceptions, we propose affinity for technology interaction (ATI), defined as the tendency to actively engage in intensive technology interaction, as a key personal resource for coping with technology. We present the 9-item ATI scale, an economical unidimensional scale that assesses ATI as an interaction style rooted in the construct need for cognition (NFC). Results of multiple studies (n {\textgreater} 1500) showed that the scale achieves good to excellent reliability, exhibits expected moderate to high correlations with geekism, technology enthusiasm, NFC, self-reported success in technical problem-solving and technical system learning success, and also with usage of technical systems. Further, correlations of ATI with the Big Five personality dimensions were weak at most. Based on the results, the ATI scale appears to be a promising tool for research applications such as the characterization of user diversity in system usability tests and the construction of general models of user-technology interaction.},

  abstract   = {From the Publisher: In 1996, recognizing this book, ACM's Special Interest Group on Documentation (SIGDOC) presented Ben Shneiderman with the Joseph Rigo Award. SIGDOC praised the book as one "that took the jargon and mystery out of the field of human-computer interaction" and attributed the book's success to "its readability and emphasis on practice as well as research." In revising this best-seller, Ben Shneiderman again provides a complete, current, and authoritative introduction to user-interface design. The user interface is the part of every computer system that determines how people control and operate that system. When the interface is well designed, it is comprehensible, predictable, and controllable; users feel competent, satisfied, and responsible for their actions. In this book, the author discusses the principles and practices needed to design such effective interaction. Based on 20 years experience, Shneiderman offers readers practical techniques and guidelines for interface design. As a scientist, he also takes great care to discuss underlying issues and to support conclusions with empirical results. Interface designers, software engineers, and product managers will all find here an invaluable resource for creating systems that facilitate rapid learning and performance, yield low error rates, and generate high user satisfaction. Coverage includes the human factors of interactive software (with added discussion of diverse user communities), tested methods to develop and assess interfaces, interaction styles (like direct manipulation for graphical user interfaces), and design considerations (effective messages, consistent screen design, appropriate color).},

Whether a library decides to develop a responsive site, a separate mobile site, or a native app, it is only part of the whole library mobile experience. Libraries’ active presence on the mobile Web is now a must, and libraries need to skillfully and creatively adapt themselves to the new information landscape characterized by the abundance of information and the scarcity of human attention.},
